# LocationModeller

This repository offers an android service and activity for the collection of the user's location in conjunction with time. Rather than an application, it may serve as a friendly collector and processor for other applications. It collects the location of the user through time and derive the relevant geographic location by the google map api. 

A default activity for display of the user's most frequented places would be displayed with elementary rendering.
